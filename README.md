# PHP7 Internals - Become a Wizard
Welcome to the PHP Internals Hub - If you ever wondered about how PHP works internally and how you can exploit it: this is where you should start. 

In this repo, I show basic **and** advanced exploitation in PHP (some of the bugs reported by me). In every "chapter", you'll learn a little bit more about PHP Internals from an infosec perspective.


> IMPORTANT: This repository does not cover explanations about memory corruption bugs. You have to be **somewhat** familiar with bugs like Format String attacks and Basic Heap Exploitation.
>  
> The good news are: you also **don't have to be an expert**. This repo is intended for hackers who solve a lot of crackme challenges but want to step-up their game to a "real-world" binary pwn.

## Why Should I learn PHP Internals Exploitation?
Learning PHP Internals has a lot more than just remote exploits:
* Some bugs can be exploited by a remote attacker. Like ``unserialize()``, ``mail()``, ``get_headers()`` and more. And in order to really understand them - you'll have to dig into PHP Internals.
* Second thing is: Because the bugs are in the "Zend land", it enables attackers to break any hardened PHP environment (i.e, bypassing ``disable_functions`` and ``open_basedir``.
* If you find memory corruption bugs in Apache, you can trigger those bugs with mod_php and get root shell (since the parent process of apache runs as root), a very cool example is the CARPE DIEM exploit, where @cfreal used a PHP7 0day to trigger a bug he found in Apache's SHM: https://cfreal.github.io/carpe-diem-cve-2019-0211-apache-local-root.html
* Because this is fu\*\*ing cool ok? Who doesn't want to turn into godmode in PHP?

## What about unserialize() ?

I didn't include the infamous ``unserialize()`` here because a lot of people did it before me & there's bunch of literature about it. The focus here is more about the runtime of PHP & the Zend Engine. Moreover, if you want to understand ``unserialize()`` you'll have to go through the "beginner's phase" and this is exactly what this repo is about: by learning the bugs above you'll find yourself learning about how variables and objects are stored internally and how the memory in PHP is managed (which is **super** important if you're trying to pwn ``unserialize()``).
